# My Python TUI Project Template

This is a Python terminal user interface (TUI) project template that combines the following libraries:

- `black`: To automate formatting.
- `nuitka`: To compile the project for distribution.
- `pre-commit`: To active pre-commit hooks, including `black`.
- `pytest`: To test the project.
- `textual`: To build the TUI.
